# healthplans_next

## INSTALL
- Use npm install --legacy-peer-deps
- Make a .env file with HEALTHCARE_API_KEY
- npm run dev

## TODO

- Some states don't use HealthCare.gov as their marketplace and so the API won't work, show an appropriate modal informing the user if they're in one of those states
- Change location API call to use tanstack
